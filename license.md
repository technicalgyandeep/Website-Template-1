MIT OpenCourseWare respects your privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it, such as when you provide email contact information to subscribe to the OCW newsletter, send feedback to OCW, or respond to a survey. If you voluntarily provide your email address or other contact information, we might also use it to inform you of changes to OCW, to survey you about your use or opinion of OCW, or to ask for your support. At your request, we will remove your contact information from our files.

We do not make your contact information or any other personally identifiable information available to anyone outside OCW or its service providers (who use the information only for authorized OCW purposes) unless we are legally required to do so.

In addition to the above, we collect certain anonymous (non-personally identifiable) information to help us improve the OCW web site and to evaluate the access and use of OCW materials and the impact of OCW on the worldwide educational community:

We collect information you provide about your use of and satisfaction with OCW through email you send us, through the OCW feedback form, and through OCW surveys, whether or not you voluntarily include your contact information.
We use the Google Analytics web analytics service, which collects certain data about this website’s traffic via a DoubleClick cookie and the standard Google Analytics implementation.  The specific Google Analytics feature we use is Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.  Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting enables OCW to use information such as user age, gender and interests from Google’s Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data to improve services on the OCW website and to help us understand the aggregate demographics of our users.  We cannot and do not obtain personally-identifiable information from Google Analytics.  OCW does not and will not merge any personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information unless you have been given notice of and have given prior affirmative (i.e. opt-in) consent to that merger.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to OCW is restricted by the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this website by disabling (opting out) the Google Analytics cookie. You can also view and change the currently available settings for Google Ads.
We use Facebook Pixel code built into our website to track conversion, optimization and remarketing of our Facebook advertising. The data are saved and processed by Facebook; OCW cannot see any personal data about you. The data may be used by Facebook in accordance with their privacy policy for other purposes unrelated to OCW, including showing you advertisements from Facebook and Facebook partners. You can opt out of Facebook’s use of cookies and Facebook Pixel remarketing through settings on your Facebook account.
We may use other web analysis tools that are built into the OCW web site to measure and collect anonymous session information.
We also use "cookies" to improve your OCW web experience and to collect anonymous information about how you use OCW. However, cookies are not required for OCW use. If your browser is configured not to accept cookies, you will still be able to access OCW and its content.
When we report information about OCW access, use, and impact, we report aggregate, non-personally identifiable data. Occasionally, we report quoted feedback from users. We do not attribute feedback to specific individuals unless we obtain permission to use that person's name along with the feedback.
